Applying unsupervised Machine Learning principles to Cryptocurrency data


## Overview

In this repository, we practice applying Unsupervised Machine Learning principals to a dataset of cryptocurrency data. We seek to group the coins based on a Principal Component Analysis of the coins' Hash Algorithm, Proof Type, Total Coins Mines, and Total Coin Supply. 

After reducing the dimensionality of our data into 3 Principal Components, the coins were grouped into 4 groups, after a K-means test to determine the optimal number of identifiable groups. 

Our results show two primary groups, separated along Principal Component 1, along with two outlier groups. Due to the reduction in dimensionality, the exact reason for this grouping is currently unknown. Methods of interpretting principal components may yield further information.
